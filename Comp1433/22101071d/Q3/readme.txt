Question3
PartA
Proven from formulas of Binomial Distribution into negative binomialProbability Mass function
Calculated mean and vairance after

PartB
Use rnbinom and dnbinom to caculate two different functions of the data
Plug into two data frames for the two scatter plots
Print out scatter plot of the simulated and theoretical probability mass functions results

Part C
Use mean and variance formula found in part A and plugging in values to calculate
Plug in r and p to get the mean
But because calculated mean is the first week of death, then -1 week would be the weeks survived

Plug in r and p to get the variance
Square root the variance to get the standard deviation

PartD
Use geomatric distribution to get results for 1 life
Plug in X,p and r to get the result
Use negative binomial distribution to get results for 9 lives
Plug in X,p and r to get the result

Then in r, simulate the two results
Use rnbinom to calculate 600000 date sets of values and for 1 life and 9 lives to minimize differences because of quantity of data sample
For two data sets find frequency of number of success
calculate the probability by dividing the number of successes with total datasets
