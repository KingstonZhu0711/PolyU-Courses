Notes for running Q1
Using library and iris data set first
Assigning first 3 points and choose the Petal Length and Petal Width to put into a string for better calculation 

100 iterations returning different data sets back to empty every iteration
and calcualtes the mean distance of data points to their respective cluster and putting into a list.

Then chose the min distance from the cluster point and assigning it into groups

Then calculate the mean distance of data points to their respective cluster of each group and append into totalmeandistance for final line plot.

After that, assign new cluster points of the mean of each group and start new iteration.

Finally, put datas into data frames and print out final scatter point group with group data 1,2,3 and line plot with 3 group's mean distance of 100 iterations
